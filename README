My GCSE Quadcopter project: the aim of which is to create a fully-functional, four rotored, remote control helicopter from scratch. 
Uses a custom designed PCB with an atmega3280 as the core microcontroller, usign the arduino bootloader.

The IMU is made up of a 3-axis accelerometer, a 2-axis gyro and a 1-axis gyro to get 6 degrees of freedom. There is the possibility of extending this to include a magnetometer and GPS in the future.

There will also be an ultrasonic rangefinder on board for low-level altitude control.
